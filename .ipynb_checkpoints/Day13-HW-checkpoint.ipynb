    "**Response Q1** The issue with this graph is that dates are being ordered by covid case amounts, not by chronological order.

    "**Response Q2** I believe I have heard a saying along the lines of \"society is built upon the little lies we tell ourselves and others,\" and I think a certain amount of mistruth is actually necessary to keep a country working properly. That said, it is not necessarily moral to take advantage of others' faith in your words, even if you do so for their own good. What one person thinks is good may be far from what another may believe, and mistruth prevents others from making informed decisions based on their own morals. But then again, even that statement is based on my own beliefs as to what consitutes good (which includes rights to freedom). Someone else may believe it is actively immoral not to mislead others for their benefit (or even the benefit of some higher ideal). The only real problem with this is that you either end up with a society with major blindspots, or a society that doesn't trust anything anyone says."

One rule could be that every data record must duplicate at least 1-10% of other data records (save for id) depending on the sample size, minimum 100 or so.

    "The most misleading part of the given graph is the use of two different scales for the two lines, despite them being graphed on top of one another. The line for counties on the mask mandate is on a scale of 15 to 25, whereas the line for counties without a mask mandate is on a scale of 4 to 14. This makes it appear as if cases in mask-mandate counties eventually dropped below cases in non-mask-mandate counties. In reality, even at their lowest point, the count of cases for mask-mandate counties was half again as high as that for unmasked counties. It seems as though the graph's creator was attempting to show that mask mandates had a real effect on case numbers by comparing the downward trend of cases in masked counties to the more-static trend of cases in non-mask counties. While the graph does adequately show the trend difference, it would have been just as effective and less misleading to use one scale for both."
